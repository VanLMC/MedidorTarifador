When i finished my Electronic Technician course this is the code i made for my classe's project. It measures current and voltage to find how much a house is spending with energy over time and then applies the calculation to show it in BRL. In every different tax range and flag
We used the PIC 18F4550. The library for this microcontroller is needed. It also requires the LCD.C library to work with he 16x2 display. If you want to test the project without using a microcontroller and a lcd you can run it with Proteus.
The main code(which i made) is 2x16_Display_Version.c
